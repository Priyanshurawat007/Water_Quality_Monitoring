# Water Quality Monitoring (WQM)

## Problem Statement
This project aims to develop a Complaint Management System to streamline the process of handling citizen grievances for a city administration. Through a userfriendly web application interface, citizens can submit complaints regarding issues such as water leakage and contamination.

## Objectives
- To develop a platform for reporting water quality complaints.
- To implement a system to manage and visualize submissions.

## SDG 6 Alignment

The WQM platform supports Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) by providing tools and resources to improve water quality and promote sustainable water monitoring practices. Through our complaint management system, we address water quality issues promptly, contributing to the goal of ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.
